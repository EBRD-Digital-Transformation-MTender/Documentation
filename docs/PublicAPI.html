            <hr>
            <p class="c14"><span class="c11"></span></p>
            <p class="c38"><span class="c11">The public API is the only interface to use the Central Business Process
                    Engine that
                    is the core unit of infrastructure. The API is a CQRS interface that provides programmatic access
                    to BPE. It
                    provides predictable URLs for accessing resources, and uses built-in HTTP features to receive
                    commands and
                    return responses. This makes it easy to communicate with. The API accepts JSON or form-encoded
                    content in
                    requests. It returns JSON content in all of its responses, including errors.</span></p>
            <h2 class="c82" id="h.CQRS"><span>CQRS approach</span></h2>
            <p class="c38"><span class="c11">In traditional architectures, the same data model is used to query and
                    update a
                    database. That&#39;s simple and works well for basic CRUD operations. In more complex applications,
                    however,
                    this approach can become unwieldy. For example, on the read side, the application may perform many
                    different
                    queries, returning data transfer objects (Data Transfer Objects or DTOs) with different shapes.
                    Object mapping
                    can become complicated. On the write side, the model may implement complex validation and business
                    logic. As a
                    result, you can end up with an overly complex model that does too much. Another potential problem
                    is that read
                    and write workloads are often asymmetrical, with very different performance and scale requirements.</span></p>
            <p class="c38"><span class="c11">Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) - an architecture
                    which addresses
                    these problems by separating reads and writes into separate models, using commands to update data,
                    and queries
                    to read data.</span></p>
            <ul class="c56 lst-kix_list_1-0 start">
                <li class="c48 c84 c92"><span class="c11">Commands should be task based, rather than data centric.
                        Commands may be
                        placed on a queue for asynchronous processing, rather than being processed synchronously.</span></li>
                <li class="c38 c84"><span class="c11">Queries never modify the database. A query returns a DTO that
                        does not
                        encapsulate any knowledge.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="c38"><span class="c11">Compared to the single data model used in CRUD-based systems, the use of
                    separate
                    query and update models for the data in CQRS-based systems simplifies design and implementation.</span></p><a

            <p class="c38"><span class="c11">For greater isolation, the read and the write data could be physically
                    separated. In
                    that case, the read database can use its own data schema that is optimized for queries. For
                    example, it can
                    store a materialized view of the data, in order to avoid complex joins or mappings. It might even
                    use a
                    different type of data store. If separate read and write databases are used, they must be kept in
                    sync.
                    Typically this is accomplished by having the write model publish an event whenever it updates the
                    DB. </span></p>

            <ul>
                <li>1. The Contracting Authority (CA) publishes a notice;</li>
                <li>2. Interested Economic Operators (EOs) must submit a request to participate in response to this
                    notice;</li>
                <li>3. Only those EOs which are pre-selected by the CA may submit offers.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This report describes how the MTender (the System) may be used for a restricted procedure according to
                the

            <p>This is a procedural use-case and no individual transactions are defined. Reference is made to other
                profiles, in which the transactions and the transaction information requirements are listed and

            <p>At the system level, it is necessary to implement several online procedure based on a selective
                procurement

            <h4>Common flow of an online selective procedure for utilities</h4>
            <p>The following Business Process Model Notation (BPMN) covers the common flow of the procurement procedure
                for
                utilities based on a selective method:</p>

            <h5>Preparation of the Contract Notice</h5>
            <p>The general flow of an online procedure based on a selective method starts with a line in the annual
                procurement plan (Prior Information Notice or simplified Prior Notice - PAPI-1-1: Procurement
                initiation -
                prior notices) based on a described need (PAPI-0-1: Expenditure Item) and the sources of financing
                (PAPI-0-2: Funding Source) declared for such a need. </p>
            <p>The preparation of a Call for Expressions of Interest (EoI) under an online procurement procedure based
                on a
                selective method consists of the preparation and publication of a Contract Notice (CN) based on a prior
                notice. </p>
            <p>For the preparation of the CN, the following crucial parameters shall be determined as follows:</p>

            <p>Along with the publication of a CN for an online procurement procedure based on a selective method, the
                time-frame for the submission of expressions of interest by EOs shall be established in the
                pre-qualification phase. </p>
            <p>A separate preQualification block shall be included into a command model:</p>
            <div class="sourceCode">

            <h6>Submission of expressions of interest by interested EOs </h6>
            <p>EOs can submit an EoI during a certain period of time indicated in the tender documents. Each EoI shall
                fulfill all the requirements detailed through the qualification criteria stated by the CA. </p>
            <p>Such requests must be based on the following submission schema:</p>

            <h6>4.2.2 Enquiries - requests and clarifications</h6>
            <p>EOs can send requests for clarification during a certain period of time indicated in the CN
                enquiryPeriod,
                according to PAPI-12-1: Clarification of conditions.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold">Initiation of pre-qualification</p>
            <p style="font-style: italic">Disclosure of submissions</p>
            <p>When enough EoI are received from EOs, the submitted EoI must be disclosed using the submissions array
                according to the following schema:</p>
            <div class="sourceCode">
                <p>{</p>

            </div>
            <p style="font-style: italic">Establishment of a period for qualification by the CA</p>
            <p>In order to indicate that the qualification phase of a procurement process has started, a separate
                qualificationPeriod.startDate shall be added into a preQualification:</p>
            <div class="sourceCode">
                <p>{</p>
                <p> "preQualification":{</p>

            </div>
            <p style="font-style: italic">Qualification of envelopes</p>
            <p>Along with the initiation of the pre-qualification phase by the CA, a set of qualifications must be
                established against each EoI received in order to allow the CA to reflect the decision taken regarding
                the
                EoI. </p>
            <div class="sourceCode">

                <p> ]</p>
                <p>}</p>
            </div>
            <p>Such objects are initially established with status:pending and statusDetails:awaiting. Since no order is
                stated for the pre-qualification sequence, the CA can qualify the received EoI randomly. </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold">Declaration of non-conflict of interest</p>
            <p>Before starting the qualification phase, all members of the evaluation panel (see Profile PAPI-11-6:
                Evaluation panel) shall provide a declaration of non-conflict of interest according to the common flow
                described in Profile PAPI-8-1: Declaration of absence of conflict of interest by CA.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold">Qualification of EoI</p>
            <p>Once all declarations of non-conflict of interest against a specific EO which submitted an EoI are
                provided
                by the evaluation committee, the related qualification for this EoI may be switched into statusDetails:
                consideration.</p>
            <p style="font-style: italic">Consideration</p>
            <p>The CA shall update the qualification with all the required meta-data, being allowed to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add qualification.documents if needed;</li>
                <li>add text qualification.description where any justification is needed; </li>
                <li>add qualification.internalID (if any).</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-style: italic">Indication of a decision</p>
            <p>Once the revision of a specific EoI is complete and the related qualification is fully updated with all
                relevant data, the CA shall switch this qualification into one of the following states, reflecting the
                decision taken:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>qualification.statusDetails: active means that the EoI is qualified (that is, that the EO will be
                    invited to submit an offer);</li>
                <li>qualification.statusDetails: unsuccessful - means that the EoI is disqualified.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-style: italic">Qualification protocol</p>
            <p>Once the CA has completed the revision of the received EoI and all the qualifications are updated with
                relevant meta-data, the CA must indicate the end of the pre-qualification phase by submitting a
                qualification protocol.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold">Completion of qualification</p>
            <p>If no blockages arise during the stand-still period (out of system), the CA can initiate the end of the
                pre-qualification phase by initiating the second stage of the selective procedure, that is, the
                tendering
                phase. In order to do so, a tenderPeriod for this second stage needs to be defined by the CA:</p>
            <div class="sourceCode">

            <h4>Tendering</h4>
            <h5>Invitations for qualified EOs </h5>
            <p>Once the pre-qualification phase and the following stand-still period are over, and when the tendering
                phase
                is initiated by the CA in order to disclose the offers by the short-list of invited EOs, a separate
                array
                invitations will be generated with a separate element for each invited EO (that is, those with

                withdrawn or amended. </p>
            <h4>Electronic Auction</h4>
            <p>Electronic Auctions (eAuction) can be used as a part of the process, according to Profile PAPI-11-5:

            </div>

            <h5>Establishment of a period for evaluation </h5>
            <p>A separate object awardPeriod must be added into a tender when the specific start date for awarding is
                automatically set: </p>
            <div class="sourceCode">

            <h5>Evaluation of offers </h5>
            <p>Along with the establishment of the tender.awardPeriod.startDate, a set of awards must be established
                for
                each offer received in order to allow the CA to reflect the decision taken for these offers. Such
                objects
                are based on the award schema and are initially defined with status:pending for all. </p>

            <h5>Initial ranking based on award criteria </h5>
            <p>Depending on tender.awardCriteria and tenderAwardCriteriaDetails, offers can or cannot be initially
                automatically ranked according to Profile PAPI-7-2: Initial ranking for evaluation. </p>
            <h5>Evaluation by the CA </h5>
            <p>Once an initial ranking is available (according to the awarding methodology applied), the CA can start
                the
                manual evaluation of offers according to either PAPI-7-1: Simple manual evaluation or PAPI-7-3: Scoring
                function - advanced evaluation. </p>
            <h5>Completion of the procedure </h5>
            <p>The evaluation process ends with the submission of a protocol that reflects the results of the tendering
                procedure. Once evaluation is completed and each received offer’s state is updated, the CA submits the
                evaluation protocol which indicates the publication of the Contract Award Notice (CAN) according to
                Profile
                PAPI-9-1: Award decision - contract award notice. This protocol has to be submitted for each lot
                separately. </p>

            <h3>Business processes</h3>
            <p>The following diagrams show the choreography of the business processes implemented by the Profile. The
                choreography defines the sequence of interactions when the Profile is run within its context.</p>
            <h4>Pre-conditions</h4>
            <p>The process for the establishment of a framework agreement begins from a cameral demand analysis (based
                on detailed expenditure items of the Buyers) and aggregated planning as a multi-relation with a number
                of periodic indicative notices (Prior Information Notice or simplified Prior Notice - PAPI-1-1:
                Procurement initiation - prior notices), based on described need (PAPI-0-1: Expenditure Item) and the
                sources of financing (PAPI-0-2: Funding Source) declared for such a need by the other Buyers who intend
                to become a party of further framework agreement by CPB.</p>
            <h4>Initiation of a framework agreement </h4>
            <p>Initiation of a framework agreement is an offline process by CPB. It is based on analysis of a buyer's
                demand described by publishing the lists of expenditure items as a part of the budgeting process.
                Having all the needs described by both obligatory and voluntary Buyers, CPB can evaluate such demand
                against overall value, geographical distribution, homogeneity, timing and so on, as well as compare it
                with a market proposition. Main goal of this stage is to decide on a provisional procurement strategy
                and inform Buyers about CPBs intention to establish a framework agreement for a specific category. All
                the following action related to scoping of a future aggregated demand and budget.</p>

            <p class="center">BPMN for common process of a framework agreement establishment</p>

            <h3>Technical design</h3>
            <p>In order to implement a Profile in a MTender system the following technical design is applied:</p>
            <h4>Preparation of framework agreement establishment</h4>
            <p>As it is stated above, contracting process for an establishment of a framework agreement based on an
                online selective procurement method and begins from a cameral demand analysis (based on detailed
                expenditure items of the Buyers) and aggregated planning as a multi-relation with a number of periodic
                indicative notices by the Buyers who intend to become a party of further framework agreement by CPB.
                Thus, an establishment of a framework agreement on a technical layer begins from an initiation of a
                relevant contracting process and publication of a draft of a future aggregated plan where all the
                relations with the periodic notices aggregated by CPB as a common scope of a framework agreement to be
                established. </p>
            <h5>Initiation of a contracting process for a framework agreement </h5>
            <p>Initiation of a contracting process in case of framework agreement goes in the same way as for any other
                procurement methods - with a publication of a planning notice (PN) which in this case is a draft of a
                future aggregated plan (AP). Thus, the relevant request for initiation of a contracting process based
                on createPN.ap command-model to be sent to a BPE: </p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <p>/do/ap?country=...&pmd=...</p>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <p>Request parameters</p>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <p>country: Identifier of country of jurisdiction according to country codelist</p>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <p>pmd: Identifier procurementMethodDetails according to pmd codelist</p>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <P>As a result, a new contracting process for a farther framework agreement (FA) with a relevant attributes
                will be initiated in the system as well as draft of a future aggregated plan (AP). </P>
            <h5>4.1.2 Collection of demand and aggregated planning </h5>
            <p>The Aggregated Plan (AP) contains information about multiple individual procurement plans. Through the
                aggregation of demand CPBs could significantly diminish costs of procedures. Procurement techniques
                that involve aggregation usually take longer to award than non-aggregated procurement processes, but
                they are associated with lower cost than running "standard“ restricted or negotiated procedures. CPBs
                are more professional and aggregation may permit greater strategic buying power Repetitive purchasing
                and issues of aggregation are inevitably evoked in the context of CPBs since the reason to establish
                them is usually to provide smaller contracting authorities with the benefits of economies of scale.</p>
            <p>On a data-level, aggregation means setting up a relationship between different data-sets and inheritance

            <h6>4.1.2.1. Collection of a needs to be included into a aggregated plan</h6>
            <p>According to a business process above, once a potential Buyer becomes aware of CPBs intention to
                establish a framework agreement for a specific category of goods or services, he can request from CPB
                an inclusion of his relevant demand and related budget into a scope of such FA. To do so, Buyer needs
                to describe his demand first by initiating a separate contracting process against previously declared
                annual needs (expenditure item classified with a certain CPV code) and publication of a relevant
                periodic notice, describes provisional schedule, budget allocated and, at least common definition of a
                subject of procurement. Once such data is ready on Buyers' side, the inclusion of a demand can be
                requested from CPB through establishing a relation between periodic notice of contracting process and
                the framework agreement. Such a relation serves as a data-hook of inclusion requests recorded.</p>

            <h6>4.1.2.3. Description of a scope of an aggregated plan</h6>
            <p>Since aggregation of a subject of procurement from multiple sources (periodic notices by Buyers) into
                single common scope (AP) doesn't seem a linear process and often requires a human-analysis, at this
                stage a subject aggregation together with a “lots” strategy goes to CPB as a manual process.</p>
            <p>In order to reflect a summary of an aggregation - subject of matter of this contracting process as a set
                of items and lots, CPB supposes to update AP with a relevant substance. To do this, relevant request

            <h7>4.1.2.3.1. Determining product categories and products</h7>
            <p>The subject matter of framework agreements is works/goods/services. However, as framework agreements are
                established for repeating needs and usually include a form of aggregated purchasing, challenges
                regarding the subject matter often occur. The issues relate to the uncertainties of how detailed the
                subject matter must be identified and described, and question whether substitution of subject is
                allowed, and if yes, to what extent. These uncertainties are particularly important within framework
                contracts, where all terms and conditions for awarding call-offs are established at the stage of
                concluding a framework - framework establishment. As a scope for change is limited in comparison with
                framework agreements, where a mini-competition or further specification of terms will be applicable.</p>
            <p>Technically, determining of a product categories is a determination of a relevant list of items with
                aggregated classification according to CPV and decomposed place of performance (delivery).</p>

            <h2 id="h.ExeFA">Execution of a Framework Agreement</h2>
            <p>In the context of a transition to digital public procurement in the Republic of Moldova, a new
                electronic procurement system was developed and implemented with the European Bank for Reconstruction
                and Development (EBRD) support.</p>
            <p>Phase 4 of the project is focused on electronic Framework Agreement (FA), covering both the conclusion
                of the FA and the subsequent purchases under a FA using the different types of contracts based on a FA
                (direct purchase, second-stage competition, etc.), and enabling the participation of Central Purchasing
                Bodies (CPB) with a specific role in the process. </p>
            <p>The use of FA will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>improve value for money and achieve cost savings by aggregating demand and getting better value for
                    money through economies of scale; </li>
                <li>reduce the administrative burden by lowering the number of procedures a Contracting Authority (CA)
                    has to run and, therefore, decreasing the time and costs linked to carrying out procurement. The
                    diminished administrative burden also applies to Economic Operators (EO) that are either awarded a
                    contract directly or are invited to participate in a simplified “Mini Competition” (MC) within the
                    FA; </li>
                <li>enable CAs to effectively manage procurement when they cannot objectively foresee the exact type
                    and/or amount of supplies, services and works for a forthcoming period. </li>
            </ul>

                functionalities related to the execution of FAs in their platforms.</p>
            <p>When a FA has been concluded with more than one EO, that FA shall be performed in one of the following
                ways by the CA or the CPB:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Following the terms and conditions of the FA, without the reopening competition, by awarding a
                    contract directly to a specific EO applying the terms governing the provision of the works,
                    services and supplies concerned and the objective conditions set in the FA;</li>
                <li>Where not all the terms governing the provision of the works, services and supplies are laid down
                    in the FA, through reopening competition amongst the EOs parties to the FA;</li>
                <li>Partly without reopening of competition and partly with reopening of competition amongst the EOs
                    parties to the FA, where this possibility has been stipulated in the procurement documents for the
                    FA.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Conclusion of the FA is described in a separate document .</p>

            <h3>Alignment with regulation</h3>
            <p>This blueprint is aligned with the following regulation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Regulation on procurements conducted through framework agreements </li>

            <p class="center small-text">Table 1 – Automated and manual award criteria depending on the ranking
                approach</p>
            <p>As shown in the table, automated ranking can be undertaken automatically using a set of criteria and the
                relevant conversions applied by the CA for each available value of each applied requirement published
                in a CN, on one hand; and the bid.requirementResponses submitted by each EO party to the FA against
                published criteria on the other hand. These two data-sets allow the normalised value for each bid based
                on the same approach to be calculated. </p>
            <p>Normalised price</p>
            <p>Where normalised price must be calculated, the following formula is applied for each tender in order to
                identify which one is most suitable by normalised price:</p>
            <p class="center">Pn = P * C1 * C2 * ... Cn </p>
            <p>where</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pn - value of normalised price</li>
                <li>P - basic price taken from bid.value or lot.value or equal to '1' depending on awardCriteria</li>
                <li>C1 ... Cn - values of the coefficients to be applied (related with values of requirements,
                    available for supplier and indicated in requirementResponses)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ranking approach</p>
            <ul>
                <li>priceOnly</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Where awardCriteria: priceOnly - only bid.value is compared in order to identify the most suitable
                tender. Cheapest goes first.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>costOnly</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Where awardCriteria: costOnly – the assumption is that all the tenderers have the same bid.value equal
                to lot.value. It means that the normalised price needs to be calculated for each bid received based on
                lot.value as a basis. Cheapest goes first.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>qualityOnly</li>
            </ul>>
            <p>Where awardCriteria: qualityOnly – the assumption is that the price doesn't matter and the only valuable
                part of the tender is quality - meaning set of values of criteria, selected by the EO while submitting
                a bid. It means that the normalised price needs to be calculated for each bid received, based on '1'.
                Most qualified goes first.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ratedCriteria</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Where awardCriteria: ratedCriteria – the assumption is that both price and value matter. It means that
                the normalised price needs to be calculated for each bid received based on ‘bid.value'. Cheapest goes
                first. </p>
            <p>Where automated ranking is the case, all the awards are ranked into order for evaluation and the first
                award (most suitable according to the prescribed evaluation function) will be switched to the next
                state ‘available for evaluation’ by the CA. </p>

            <p>Evaluation</p>
            <p>In order to evaluate an award, the CA shall update it with all the required meta-data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add any documents, if needed;</li>
                <li>add requirementResponses if there are relevant requirements related to the CA within the evaluation
                    phase prescribed by tender.criteria; </li>
                <li>add text descriptions where any justification is needed; </li>

            </ul>
            <p>Indication of a decision</p>
            <p>Once the evaluation of a specific bid is complete and the related award is fully updated with all
                relevant data, the CA shall switch the award to one of the following states, reflecting a positive or

            <h2 id="h.ResFA">Restricted Procedure</h2>
            <p>The MTender system is version 2.0 of the Automated Information System "State Register of Public
                Procurements", and is an information system compatible with cloud computing technology, which is hosted
                on the MCloud shared government platform.</p>
            <p>The "MTender" system is a systematised pool of data on public procurement contracts concluded and
                processes related to public procurement contracts, such as the planning and conduct of public
                procurement procedures, the selection and designation of winners in these procedures. The information
                resource on public procurement contracts is formed through the operation/functioning of the automated
                information system "MTender".</p>
            <h3>Aim of the document</h3>
            <p>The main purpose of this document is to provide a detailed technical design in order for the Networking
                Electronic Procurement Platforms (NEPPs) to be able to implement all the necessary processes and
                functionalities related to the restricted procedure in their platforms.</p>
            <p>Restricted procedure is a public procurement procedure regulated by the EU Directives on Public
                Procurement (EUPD), in which any interested Economic Operator (EO) can submit a request to participate
                in response to a call for competition (first stage of the procedure), but only those EOs invited to do
                so by the Contracting Authority (CA) following its assessment of the information provided may submit a
                tender (second stage of the procedure).</p>
            <h3>Alignment with regulation</h3>
            <p>This blueprint is aligned with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The regulation regarding Restricted Procedure: REGULATION on electronic tendering procedure for
                    procurement of goods, services and works via restricted tender </li>
                <li>The following standard bidding document:</li>
            </ul>


            <h2>Technical design</h2>
            <h3>Business process model</h3>
            <p>The following BPMN reflects the general process for a restricted procedure as prescribed by the EUPD,
                which has been taken as a regulatory basis for the local secondary legislation on which MTender system
                is based:</p>

            <p>More detail on the different statuses is provided in section “2.4 OCDS dataflow” of this document.</p>
            <h3>OCDS building blocks applied</h3>
            <h4>Tender</h4>
            <p>With a tender block, all the data describing an aspect of the competitive part of the tendering process
                can be designed and structured. The general scope of data needed to publish a Contract Notice (CN) for
                this type of procurement method is the same as for a single stage procedure (e.g. open tender). </p>
            <p>Along with all the common information prescribed by Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) 1.1 for a
                tender building block (https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/schema/reference/#tender), some
                specifics can also be designed as follows: </p>
            <h5>Targets</h5>
            <p>Where a CA intends to achieve particular quantifiable results within the competitive part of the
                tendering process, such targets can be designed with a targets building block. The block is built
                according to ocds_metrics_extension .</p>
            <h5>Criteria</h5>
            <p>In order to prescribe a scope of qualification and conditions for participation (exclusion grounds,
                selection and qualification criteria), a criteria building block should be used inside tender. In the
                same way, qualification and evaluation check-points for the CA itself can be included in the criteria
                array: e.g. request for declaration of absence of the conflict of interests. The block is built
                according to an eOCDS_structuredAwardCriteria .</p>
            <h5>Conversions</h5>
            <p>Once quantitative criteria have to be included into the CN as well as applicable options and weights, a
                separate extension must be applied to allow the CA to include all the conversions needed for future
                qualification and evaluation. Conversions are built on eOCDS-conversions , which is a tool that enables
                the describing of the conversions used and their applicable coefficients.</p>
            <h5>SecondStage</h5>
            <p>Building block adds a secondStage object to the tender and lot objects, to describe the second stage of
                a two-stage procedure. More specifically, it adds two fields to describe the limits on the number of
                candidates to be invited. If there is an exact limit on the number of candidates, minimumCandidates and
                maximumCandidates are set to the same number. If maximumCandidates is set, the selectionCriteria is
                used to describe how the selection criteria will be used to select candidates to be invited for the
                second stage. The block is built according to ocds_secondStageDescription_extension .</p>
            <h5>Enquiries</h5>
            <p>The enquiries extension can be used to record questions raised by the CA during a tendering process, and
                the answers provided by the EO. The ocds_enquiry_extension adds an enquiries array to tender,
                consisting of one or more enquiry objects, each with fields for a question and an answer. </p>
            <h4>Pre-qualification</h4>
            <p>The pre-qualification phase can be designed using ocds_qualification_extension . This extension also
                extends the code list for party roles with qualifiedBidders and disqualifiedBidders.</p>
            <h4>Submission</h4>
            <p>In order to express their interest in participating in a specific procurement process, EOs can submit a
                request - submission. Such an expression of interest includes self-declaration on eligibility criteria
                (both exclusion grounds and selection criteria) expressed by the CA in accordance with a notation
                prescribed by a criteria building block (see above) in a CN:</p>

            <p>Information on bids submitted as part of a procurement process. An array of a submitted bids can be
                designed using the ocds_bid_extension </p>
            <h4>Awards</h4>
            <p>The award section is used to announce any awards issued for a tender. There can be multiple awards
                made. Releases can contain all or a subset of these awards. </p>
            <h4>Contracts</h4>
            <p>The contract section is used to provide details of contracts that have been entered into. Every
                contract must have a related award, linked via the awardID field. </p>
            <h4>Parties</h4>
            <p>Each of the parties (organisations or other participants) referenced in a release must be included

                ocds_organizationClassification_extension and ocds_partyDetails_scale_extension .</p>
            <h3>OCDS dataflow</h3>
            <h4>State 0: Announcement of the initiation</h4>
            <h5>Contract Notice</h5>
            <p>The general scope of data needed to publish a CN for this type of procurement method is the same as
                for a single-stage procedure (e.g. open tender). </p>
            <h6>Subject of procurement</h6>
            <p>The goods and services to be purchased, broken into line items and lots according to a CA strategy.</p>
            <p>A tender process can be divided into lots, where EOs can submit for one or more lots. Details of
                each lot can be provided according to (ocds_lots_extension ). Items, documents and other features
                may then reference the lot they are related to, using relatedLot. Where no relatedLot identifier is
                given, the values ought to be interpreted as applicable to the whole tender.</p>
            <h6>Awarding methodology</h6>
            <p>The CA prescribes a methodology for the further qualification of submissions and evaluation of the
                tender based on the following techniques: </p>
            <p>For a qualification process, the CA describes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Qualification method –how the qualification decision will be taken: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>manual - where the CA intends to undertake a qualification process involving an evaluation
                        panel;</li>
                    <li>automated - where the CA transfers the qualification process to a system based on all the
                        qualification criteria prescribed by a CN. </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Reduction criteria – The CA prescribes criteria for the reduction of the number of candidates
                    to be invited to submit a tender: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>scoring - where there is a limitation on the number of candidates to be invited </li>
                    <li>o none - where there is no limit for the number of candidates to be invited to submit a
                        tender</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>Both attributes are to be described and included in a structure of the CN in accordance with
                ocds_otherRequirements_extension.</p>
            <p>For an evaluation process, the CA describes: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Awarding criterion – a general indicator on which the award decision will be based:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>priceOnly - where awardCriteria: priceOnly - only bid.value to be compared in order to
                        identify the most suitable tender – Cheapest goes first.</li>
                    <li>costOnly - where awardCriteria: costOnly - assumption that all the tenderers have a same
                        bid.value equal to lot.value. This means that the normalised price needs to be calculated
                        for each tender received, based on lot.value. Cheapest goes first.</li>
                    <li>qualityOnly - where awardCriteria: qualityOnly - assumption that the price doesn't matter
                        and the only valuable part of the tender is the quality - meaning the set of values of
                        criteria, selected by the EO while submitting a tender. This means that the normalised
                        price needs to be calculated for each tender received, based on '1'. Most qualified goes
                        first.</li>
                    <li>ratedCriteria - where awardCriteria: ratedCriteria - assumption that both price and quality
                        matter. This means that the normalised price needs to be calculated for each tender
                        received, based on bid.value. Cheapest goes first.</li>
                </ul>

                <li>How awarding criterion is to be applied for initial scoring of the tenders received – using a
                    separate tender.awardCriteriaDetails attribute, the CA prescribes how all the tenders received
                    shall be scored (by a system) for further evaluation:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>automated - the awarding will be approached automatically based on ‘awardCriteria’ and a
                        set of relevant requirementResponses received from the tenderers against `requirements`
                        applied by the CA.</li>
                    <li>manual - the awarding will be approached manually.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h6>Criteria and requirements</h6>
            <p>A separate criteria array can be added into the tender building block schema to describe:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Qualification and evaluation criteria and its minimum requirements;</li>
                <li>specific requirements related to a procurement subject;</li>
                <li>specific requirements related to delivery/performance;</li>
                <li>general and specific essential conditions of the future contract;</li>
                <li>requirements related to the CA; </li>
                <li>criteria for future advanced evaluation by the committee. </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="sourceCode">
                <p>{</p>

                <p>}</p>
                <p>}</p>
            </div>
            <h6>Conversions - weightings for a scoring function</h6>
            <p>A separate conversions array can be added into the tender building block:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To describe conversions used and their applicable coefficients, either as a list of precise
                    values or as a mathematical formula for calculation of the value of a particular coefficient in
                    this particular case (depending on the value received within requirementResponse related to a
                    specific requirement) to be applied;</li>
                <li>to relate each conversion used (together with coefficients) with used criteria or targets
                    (where applicable);</li>
                <li>to include applicable options to used criteria or observations for targets.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="sourceCode">
                <p>{</p>

                <p>}</p>
                <p>}</p>
            </div>
            <h6>Limit of number of participants</h6>
            <p>The CA is allowed to limit the number of candidates to be invited to submit financial and technical
                offers. Where this is a case, pre-selection instead of pre-qualification will be applied in order
                to evaluate candidates. </p>
            <p>To limit the number of candidates, secondStage building block can be included in the tender or even
                a specific lot, as shown below.</p>

                given preQualification.period, any interested EO is allowed to send a submissions - requests for
                participation or EoI. Each request shall fulfil all the requirements prescribed by the criteria

            <ul>
                <li>award.statusDetails: consideration - where an eligibility check took place previously</li>
                <li>award.statusDetails: awaiting – where an eligibility check was not conducted by the CA
                    previously</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Evaluation</h5>
            <p>To evaluate the tender, the CA shall update the related award with all the required meta-data. In
                these updates, the CA is allowed to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add any documents if needed;</li>
                <li>Add requirementResponses if there are any relevant requirements related to the CA within the
                    evaluation phase prescribed by tender.criteria; </li>
                <li>Add text descriptions where any justification is needed; </li>
                <li>Add date when the decision was taken;</li>

            <p>Indication of a decision</p>
            <p>Once the evaluation of a specific tender is complete and the related award is fully updated with all
                relevant data, the CA shall switch the award to one of the following states, reflecting a positive
                or negative decision:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>award.statusDetails: active - means the related tender is selected as a winning tender to be
                    awarded;</li>
                <li>award.statusDetails: unsuccessful - means the related tender is rejected.</li>

            </div>
            <p>As soon as the CA has completed the evaluation and the winning candidates for a particular lot are
                identified or all the proposals under this lot are rejected, the CA indicates the end of evaluation
                for the lot by publishing an intention to award a contract (award decision).</p>
            <h5>Award decision</h5>
            <p>To reflect a decision regarding each specific lot and the proposal selected to be awarded with a
                contract (award.statusDetails:active), the CA prepares a Notice on Award Decision. This data-entity
                is based on a contract schema and included in a contracts array. </p>
            <p>Since it a stand-still period for evaluation, initially these contracts are established with a
                status: pending and statusDetails, which reflects a decisions' character:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>contract.statusDetails: active where the decision regarding the lot is positive (winner is
                    identified);</li>
                <li>contract.statusDetails: unsuccessful where the decision regarding the lot is negative (all the
                    tenders were rejected).</li>
            </ul>

                <p>}</p>
            </div>
            <h5>Stand-still period</h5>
            <p>In this state, no one can take any actions except the CA, who switches the process to State4 or back
                to State2. No other actions can be prescribed for the system - all review procedures go offline,
                and the time tracking is up to the CA. </p>
            <h5>Cancellation of the award decision</h5>
            <p>To reflect a decision to cancel a specific award decision taken previously under a particular lot,
                the CA shall switch the relevant contract object into contract.status: cancelled.</p>
            <div class="sourceCode">

                <p>}</p>
            </div>
            <h5>Confirmation of the award decisions</h5>
            <p>If no blockers indicated during stand-still period, the CA can initiate contract preparation for the
                awarded lot or finalization of an unsuccessful output of a lot where all the proposals were
                rejected during the evaluation phase.</p>
            <p>Confirmation of a negative award decision</p>
            <p>Confirmation of a negative award decision requires switching the relevant contract object to final
                status: unsuccessful, with a parallel indication of the reason for a negative outcome as a
                statusDetails:</p>

            </div>
            <p>Confirmation of a positive award decision</p>
            <p>Confirmation of a positive decision requires reflecting the subsequent contract initiation into a
                relevant contract object by indicating statusDetails, provided that the object remains intermediate
                status: pending:</p>

            <h5>Contract initiation</h5>
            <p>To describe and reflect the scope of a contract to be concluded on a positive award decision, a
                parallel data-stream will be initiated. This stream is a separate OCDS-record where all the
                information related to future contracts is collected from a current procurement process. In order
                to establish the relation with this parallel stream, the relevant contract reflects a positive
                award decision and shall be extended with a relatedProcess.relationship: [x_contracting]:</p>

            <h2>Annexes</h2>
            <h3>Evaluation Committee</h3>
            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>The process of evaluation of tenders is generally carried out by a suitably competent evaluation
                panel. According to the Public Procurement Guidance for Practitioners by the European Commission,
                it is best practice to establish the Evaluation Committee as soon as the decision has been taken to
                proceed with the procurement to ensure that the procurement process is done in the most
                professional way by involving all the necessary staff qualifications from the start. </p>
            <p>The Committee needs to have a permanent core of members. Procurement, financial and legal persons
                should be permanent members. Technical staff will be members depending on the type of contract. The
                committee should ideally comprise members experienced in each of the areas to be examined in the
                tender.</p>
            <p>A chairperson is usually appointed to lead, co-ordinate, give guidance and control the process of
                evaluation of tenders. The chairperson is responsible, inter alia, for ensuring that the process of
                tender evaluation is carried out in accordance with the general law and Treaty principles as well
                as local requirements. A secretary to the evaluation panel, generally with non-voting powers, is
                often appointed for the purpose of providing support to the chairperson, carrying out the
                administrative tasks linked to the evaluation process, and keeping the minutes of each meeting.</p>
            <p>The way in which the members of the evaluation panel operate - for example, whether they assess the
                tenders independently or jointly - depends on local legislation or local practice.</p>
            <p>In principle, the evaluation panel normally has only the mandate to identify the best tender and to
                make a recommendation as to the award of the contract to the CA.</p>

            <h3>Structured criteria</h3>
            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>A set of criteria may include different types of requirements, used in different ways and for
                different reasons. Some of the criteria used may be prescribed on the legal basis “by default”
                (exclusion grounds of ESPD or particular chapters of selection grounds from ESPD, like ‘general
                yearly turnover’).</p>
            <h5>Types of criteria</h5>
            <p>Under each Tendering Process, the CA may define and apply various types of criteria:</p>
            <h6>Pre-qualification, pre-selection or the scoring function.</h6>
            <p>According to the ESPD, the structure of qualification criteria is as follows:</p>
            <p>Exclusion grounds</p>
            <p>These criteria are eligibility criteria put forward by the CA to the candidates. All of them are
                published in the CN and relate to the whole procedure.</p>
            <p>Selection criteria</p>
            <p>These criteria are also eligibility criteria, but they are optional for the CA to apply for the
                tender. The criteria allow determining the quantitative and qualitative criteria for candidates for
                participation in the procedure.</p>
            <p>Allowances</p>
            <p>These criteria are award criteria and should be taken into account by the CA in cases determined by
                the relevant law, which also defines a set of these criteria and their values. Examples include the
                following criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The proposal of the candidate-resident of the country of jurisdiction receives a reduction
                    factor;</li>
                <li>The proposal of a candidate-resident of the country of jurisdiction if the candidate is an
                    organisation in the category of SMEs receives a reduction factor of price.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Non-price criteria</p>
            <p>These criteria are award criteria and can be applied by the CA in the case of the most economically
                advantageous tender (MEAT) strategy. MEAT is recognised as winning according to the following
                criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In case of contracts for public procurement of goods - the price, delivery time, payment terms,
                    profitability, quality, aesthetic, functional and technical characteristics, capabilities and
                    cost of technical assistance and maintenance.</li>
                <li>In the case of contracts for public procurement of works - the proposed quality, cost per unit
                    of product of the tenderer by the end of the work, total price, experience of the tenderer,
                    etc. The share of the price in the total evaluation of the tenders should not be more than 80%.</li>
                <li>In the case of contracts for public procurement of services - the proposed quality, cost per
                    unit of the tenderer’s products, total price, experience of the tenderer, etc. The price share
                    in the total evaluation of the tenders should not be more than 40%.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Therefore, depending on the category of procurement, the CA can determine a set of non-price
                criteria (quantitative and qualitative) in the range of 20-60%, which will be taken into account
                along with the price part of the tender and affect the absolute economic value of the entire tender
                proposal.</p>
            <h6>Guarantees</h6>
            <p>The CA may, if deemed appropriate and proportionate, on a case-by-case basis and subject to a risk
                analysis, require contractors to lodge a guarantee. For example, in the case of works contracts, a
                performance guarantee may be required to assure the Commission that the contract will be properly
                fulfilled after provisional approval and payment of the balance, pending final acceptance.</p>
            <p>An example of this application is described by ocds_requirements_extension (example).</p>
            <p>Bid bond / Performance guarantee</p>
            <p>The guarantee is released after final acceptance of the deliverables, except where the contract has
                not been performed or has been performed incorrectly or completion is late. In these cases, a part
                of the guarantee is retained, in proportion to the seriousness of the damage suffered, at the first
                request of the Commission. If the value of the damage is greater than the sum of the guarantee, the
                whole guarantee will be retained.</p>
            <h6>Essential conditions - contract draft</h6>
            <p>The draft contract containing all the elements of the contract that will subsequently be signed is
                enclosed with the tender documents so that tenderers have all the information they need. The draft
                contract is divided into two parts:</p>
            <p>General conditions</p>
            <p>The terms that apply to all contracts of the same type, unless the special conditions derogate from
                them.</p>
            <p>Specific conditions</p>
            <p>They cover the subject and duration of the contract, the price, and arrangements for implementing
                the contract (deadlines for ordering, paying, etc.). They specify whether a performance guarantee
                must be provided by the future contractor to ensure proper implementation of the contract.</p>

            <h4>Technical design</h4>
            <p>Separate criteria array to be added into tender building block according to a criteria schema to
                describe:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Qualification and evaluation criteria and their minimum requirements;</li>
                <li>Specific requirements related to a subject of procurement;</li>
                <li>Specific requirements related to delivery/performance;</li>
                <li>General and specific essential conditions of the future contract;</li>
                <li>Requirements related to the CA; </li>
                <li>Criteria for future advanced evaluation by the committee. </li>

            <h3>Coefficients for conversion</h3>
            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>Pre-selection of the candidates and future evaluation of the tenders submitted by invited candidates
                is a critical part of the procurement process, and for this reason care must be taken to ensure
                that the outcome is the right one and that it has been decided in a fair and transparent manner.</p>
            <p>The criteria for the awarding of contracts are either the lowest price only or the MEAT. If the MEAT
                method is used, either the CN itself or the tender documents must detail all criteria to be used .
                Best practice would be to disclose in the tender notice or tender documents the scoring matrix or
                weightings being used in addition to the evaluation methodology.</p>
            <h5>Pre-qualification questionnaire (PQQ)</h5>
            <p>If it is the intention to have a shortlist of tenderers, then this must be done by fair and
                transparent means giving equal treatment to all. Thus, CAs should indicate beforehand in the CN or
                tender documents a set of minimum requirements, in particular:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The minimum requirements which characterise the nature of the procurement (which should not be
                    changed in the negotiations or evaluation);</li>
                <li>Minimum eligibility and qualification requirements to be fulfilled by any tenderer.</li>
                <p>along with</p>
                <li>The values available for each applied requirement;</li>
                <li>The relative weighting of each option available under each applied requirement.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Scoring matrix for evaluation</h5>
            <p>Tender evaluation should:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have award criteria that are weighted to reflect importance/priority and are focused on the
                    requirements of the specification (judging on quality rather than price);</li>
                <li>Be relevant to the subject matter of the contract;</li>
                <li>Preferably be based on a model that takes into account a balance between price and quality
                    where price is the dominant criteria in %. Care must be taken to ensure that the price/quality
                    split reflects the requirements of the contract;</li>
                <li>Have approval for the award criteria and the evaluation model (including weightings of each
                    criterion); and</li>
                <li>Use an Evaluation Committee made up of appropriate and relevant representation having the
                    necessary experience, technical skills and knowledge.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Technical design</h4>
            <p>A separate conversions array is added into tender building block according to a Conversions schema
                ￼‘Conversions’ is a tool that allows describing used conversions and their applicable coefficients.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To describe used conversions and their applicable coefficients, either as a list of precise
                    values or as a mathematical formula for calculation of the value of a particular coefficient in
                    this particular case (depending on the value received within requirementResponse related to a
                    specific requirement) to be applied.</li>
                <li>To relate each conversion used (together with coefficients) with used criteria or targets
                    (where applicable).</li>
                <li>To include applicable options to used criteria or observations for targets.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>True/false requirement and its coefficients of conversion</h5>
            <p>This simple criterion that requires only a true/false answer can be used by the CA. For example, if
                the currently submitting EO is a domestic tenderer, his/her tender will get a ratio that increases
                the advantage of its price by 20%:</p>

                <p>]</p>
                <p>}</p>
            </div>
            <p>Using criteria, we can describe this criterion as such. But using conversions, we can also describe
                applicable coefficients:</p>
            <div class="sourceCode">
                <p>{</p>
                <p>"conversions": [</p>

                <p>"coefficients": [</p>
                <p>{</p>
                <p>"value": true,</p>
                <p>"coefficient": 0.8</p>
                <p>},</p>

                <p>"value": false,</p>
                <p>"coefficient": 1</p>

                <p>}</p>
                <p>]</p>
                <p>}</p>
            </div>
            <p>Therefore, if the EO responds that his/her company is a domestic tenderer, using cross-reference
                through requirement.id we can extract an applicable coefficient - 0.8.</p>
            <h5>Requirement with a predefined set of coefficients of conversion for a specific criterion value</h5>
            <p>The criterion that requires a precise answer with digitalisation can be used by the CA. For example,
                when a minimum product warranty of 1 year is required for all tenders but warranties of 2 years
                receive a 15% advantage and warranties of 3 years or more receive a 30% advantage:</p>

            </table>
            <P>As shown in the above table, automated ranking can be undertaken automatically using a set of
                criteria and the relevant conversions applied by the CA for each available value of each applied
                requirement and published in a CN, on one hand; and the bid.requirementResponses submitted by each
                EO against published criteria on the other hand. These two data-sets allow the normalised value for
                each bid based on the same approach to be calculated. </P>
            <h4>Normalised price</h4>
            <p>Where normalised price must be calculated, the following formula is applied for each tender in order
                to identify which one is most suitable by normalised price:</p>
            <p>Pn = P * C1 * C2 * ... Cn </p>
            <p>where</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pn - value of normalised price</li>
                <li>P - basic price taken from bid.value or lot.value or equal to '1' depending on awardCriteria</li>
                <li>C1 ... Cn - values of the coefficients to be applied (related with a values of requirements,
                    available for EO and indicated in requirementResponses)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Ranking approach</h4>
            <h5>priceOnly</h5>
            <p>Where awardCriteria: priceOnly - only bid.value is compared in order to identify the most suitable
                tender. Cheapest goes first.</p>
            <h5>costOnly</h5>
            <p>Where awardCriteria: costOnly – the assumption is that all the tenderers have the same bid.value
                equal to lot.value. It means that the normalised price needs to be calculated for each bid received
                based on lot.value as a basis. Cheapest goes first.</p>
            <h5>qualityOnly</h5>
            <p>Where awardCriteria: qualityOnly – the assumption is that the price doesn't matter and the only
                valuable part of the tender is quality - meaning set of values of criteria, selected by the EO
                while submitting a bid. It means that the normalised price needs to be calculated for each bid
                received, based on '1'. Most qualified goes first.</p>
            <h5>ratedCriteria</h5>
            <p>Where awardCriteria: ratedCriteria – the assumption is that both price and value matter. It means
                that the normalised price needs to be calculated for each bid received based on ‘bid.value'.
                Cheapest goes first. </p>
            <p>Where automated ranking is the case, all the awards are ranked into order for evaluation and the
                first award (most suitable according to the prescribed evaluation function) will be switched to the
                next state ‘available for evaluation’ by the CA. </p>

            <h4>Technical design</h4>
            <p>The issue of considering a "certificate" as a core extension was reviewed by the OCP helpdesk and
                the following conclusion was made: "There has been some discussion of approvals and certification
                in open-contracting/standard#403 and the work in the Requirements Extension can potentially be used
                to model a requirement that a supplier needs to be certified in a particular way.". Based on this,
                the following approach could be applied in the system to cover the DoI needs:</p>
            <h5>Request of Declaration</h5>
            <p>Since the declaration is the same for all the members of the evaluation panel (either single

                criteria, related to the organisation appointed as a CA:</p>
